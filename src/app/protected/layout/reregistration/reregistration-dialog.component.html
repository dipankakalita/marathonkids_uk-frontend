	It's great to have you back for another year of running!<br /><br />

	First you need to upload your Runners CSV so we know who is running this year! Once uploaded you will find all External Distances will continue from previous years while the Internal Distances will reset to zero for this academic year. The parents can also monitor the year on year progress on our Marathon Kids UK App via their emails registered with the School. <br /><br />

	If you need any help, please email schools@marathonkids.co.uk
